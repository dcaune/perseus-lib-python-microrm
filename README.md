Majormode Perseus Common Python Library is a repository of reusable
Python components to be shared with some Python projects.

These components have minimal dependencies on other libraries, so that
they can be deployed easily.  In addition, these components will keep
their interfaces as stable as possible, so that other Python projects
can integrate these components without having to worry about changes
in the future.
